  p.about-metext Currently I can write css and html and a little bit vue.js. I’m working as an intern in web studio. I’m not interested in only web, I like architecture, graphic, ui, product as well. I’d like to try many new things. I like coffee, mangas, films, cheeseburger and travel.
    | I post on instagram about my travel. My dream is remote-working abroad with a  computer once.
